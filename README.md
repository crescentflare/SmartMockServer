# SmartMockServer

Easily set up a mock server using NodeJS which is able to serve JSON (and several other) responses. Also contains a set of additional features to make the mock server more flexible, like multiple responses on a single endpoint by filtering parameters.


### Features

* Easy to set up, install NodeJS and start the module with only a few lines of code
* Fully data-driven, endpoints can be created easily by creating folders and placing response JSON (or other formats like HTML) files
* Create alternative responses on a single endpoint using get parameter or post body filters (with wildcard support)


### Status

The project is new, but it should be useful in its current form. The example shows how to set up different kind of responses, alternative responses and how to make an overview index page.
